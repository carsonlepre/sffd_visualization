# sffd_visualization
[Visualization of SFFD calls by neighborhood. Python script calls on SFFD API. Loads data into database, then leaflet visualizes the data into a heatmap.]

In fact, our final version does not include an API call, it relies on a preloaded SQLite database and it visualizes the data into a choropleth, rather than into a heat map. Choropleth boundaries are actual SFFD station areas.
